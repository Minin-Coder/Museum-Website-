            1. After Pakistan and India gained independence, Maharaja Hari Singh's delay in deciding the future of Jammu

            intensified when Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession in favour of India on 26 October
            1947, against the wishes of the locals (77.12%), thus leading to an armed revolt.

            could not be carried out; being inhospitable terrain. Area remained un-demarcated even in Karachi and Shimla
            Agreements; demarcating Ceasefre Line upto point NJ 9842 and stating that it would run “thence north to the
            glaciers” in Karachi Agreement 1949. Basing on these agreements, the area from NJ 9842 to Karakoram Pass
            remained part of Pakistan till 1984, when Indian Forces cunningly occupied it and asserted their false claim
            on Siachen.

            3. Historically, cartographers have always shown Siachen as part of Pakistan. Likewise, the
            movement of mountaineers/ expeditions in the area was also regulated by Pakistan till 1980s. Between 1974
            -1981, 16 major expeditions explored Siachen by taking permits from the Pakistani Government. Out of these,
            11
            were from Japan, 3 were from Austria and one each from Britain and US thereby, further validating Pakistan’s
            claim over Siachen Region. India accidently recovered international maps of the area from a German
            expedition,
            depicting Siachen as part of Pakistan. Accession of Aksai Chin to China and fear of loss of land, suddenly
            brought Siachen in the focus of Indian policy makers.

            never occupied by Pakistan Army. Indian Army sent its 1st military expedition to Teram Kangri in 1978
            followed
            by two other expeditions in 1980 and 1981. Based on multiple intelligence reports of Indian incursions,
            Pakistan also sent out a number of trekking expeditions to keep a track on Indian movements. Indian presence
            in Siachen was first confirmed by a Pakistani Police Officer patrolling the area in 1981; 15 - 20 Indians
            were
            reported in general area Chumik and Chulling Glacier.

            August 1983. However, Indian Army, blatantly violated international norms and cunningly intruded into
            Pakistani Territory for occupation of passes leading to Siachen Glacier in April 1984. In order to check
            Indian intrusion, Pakistan Army occupied a defensive position along Sia La, Bilafond La, Chulling La and

            Kashmir Regiment was heli dropped near Point 22158 to achieve surprise against the enemy. As a result of
