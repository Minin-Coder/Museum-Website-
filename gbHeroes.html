     <h1><b>Group Captain shah Khan</b></h1>
    <p>During liberation of Skardu, Ibex Force was assisted by <b>Eskimo Force under the able Command of Lieutenant Shah <br> Khan</b>. Task of Eskimo Force was to
counter and neutralize enemy Z Brigade which was launched to restore the <br>deteriorated situation in Skardu. <b>Lieutenant Shah Khan striked enemy’s lifeline by capturing Kargil and Dras</b>. <br>
thereby creating an imbalance in enemy’s disposition. The enemy was absolutely unaware of the movement of Eskimo <br> Force. On 10th May 1948, attack on Dras was launched. Indians, asanticipated sent a company size reinforcement but <br> it <b>was ambushed in Kharu Pahar area in which bulk of the enemy force was annihilated and rest
surrendered</b>. Later, <br> attack at Kargil was launched. On approaching Kargil, it was learnt that entire Garrison was watching a Polo Match. He <br> occupied the
adjoining hills on the Southern Side and started shelling the Polo Ground. Resultantly, panic erupted and <br> the <b>enemy fled towards Leh without putting up a fight thus the vital Kargil Town was liberated unopposed.</b> The loss <br>of
Kargil and Dras, coupled with the bold offensive actions of Ibex Force,
created paralysis in Z Brigade, forcing it to <br>withdraw leaving behind numerous dead and prisoners of war. <b>The force continued its advance and
captured Zojila Pass in addition to a considerable area in Nubra Valley.</b>
Lieutenant Shah Khan showed outstanding courage during <br> the attack oncaptured Zojila Pass in addition to a considerable area in Nubra Valley.
Lieutenant Shah Khan showed <br> outstanding courage during  the attack on
Kargil and Drass by leading from the front despite heavy enemy fire. He led <br>
attack after attack without caring for his life. It was through his inspiring leadership and bold planning that Kargil was captured with a very few casulities. On this brave act, he was awarded <b>“Sitara-e-Jurat”</b>.</p>

       <div class="text mt-2"><p>Maj Ihsan Ali was the first man from Gilgit Region to get commissioned in
            Kashmir State Army in 1932. The offensive <br> plan to liberate Baltistan from
            India’s illegal occupation by capturing Zojila and Traghbal Passes was termed
            as <br><b>“Operation Sledge”</b>. The force was divided into three components i.e Ibex
            Force, Tiger Force and Eskimo Force. <b>Ibex <br> Force was led by Maj Ihsan Ali.</b> He
            inspired his under command through courage, resilience and fostering a culture of <br> trust and bondage. On 6th February 1949, Ibex Column started its advance
            towards Skardu - Kargil - Zojila Approach. <br>
            On reaching Astak, it was learnt that
            enemy defences at Tsari were held by two platoons.The enemy platoon <br>
            deployed along right bank of the river was planned to be relieved by Dogra
            Platoon. Major Ihsan decided to get across <br> the enemy positions as quickly as
            possible. This <b>bold and swift action enabled Maj Ihsan to attack Skardu</b>
            without <br>any delay. He established a blocking position to ambush the Dogra
            Platoon. After an intense fight, the Dogra Platoon <br>was completely annihilated.
            <b>On reaching Skardu Ibex Force laid siege to Skardu Garrison and Kharpocho
            Fort and compelled the enemy to surrender</b>. The enemy reinforcement to
            relieve the besieged Garrison under command <br>Brigadier Faqir Singh were
            successfully ambushed and <b>destroyed at Thurgo Pari</b>. Later, the enemy sent
            Z Brigade to <br> restore the situation in Skardu. After heavy fight the advance of
            Z Brigade could not make any progress and was thus <br> forced to withdraw. It was through the courageous leadership of Maj Ihsan that the enemy forces were
            destroyed <br>West of Skardu in early 1948.
            It was through his inspiring leadership that the Indian Forces were pushed
            back upto <br> Kargil. On this exemplary act of bravery and courage, he was
            awarded <b>“Sitara-e-Jurat”</b>.</p>

       <div class="text mt-2"><p>Captain Hassan Khan was an epitome of courage and audacious leadership.
            During Gilgit Baltistan Liberation War,<br> <b>Tiger Force under his command was tasked to secure Traghbal Pass, Gurez and Kishanganga Valleys.</b> On 04 <br>
            March 1948, he left for Bandipura when Burzil and Traghbal Passes were
            under 10 -15 feet snow. On reaching <br> Sundarwan, he learnt the presence of an
            enemy Brigade in Bandipura. The force occupied defenses at Traghbal Pass <br> to
            check enemy advance towards Gurez Valley. Frontier Constabulary and Chitral
            Scouts also arrived in Kishanganga <br> Valley and occupied the Traghbal Defile.
            In 1st week of June 1948, enemy unveiled its evil designs and launched first <br>
            major attack towards Traghbal. Enemy advanced upto Gurez and captured the
            area with very well equipped and <br> logistically supported force. Captain Hassan
            assessed the threat, mustered up the available troops and brought them <br>
            forward. Before the enemy could resume advance, the vacant areas were
            re-occupied. Due to his daring <b>leadership <br> morale of own troops rose again
            and enemy advance halted</b>. He launched a quick attack on Domel and Dudgai
            and <br> recaptured the areas after stiff resistance. By the end of July 1948, situation
            on all fronts was considerably stabilized <br>except Skardu and Leh. <b>Gilgit Scouts
            were defending vast frontage with 3000 scouts and volunteers with very <br>
            limited logistic support against highly trained Indian Army, triple in size and
            equipment.</b> <br>
                        It was due to great determination, valour and selflessness by Captain
            Hassan that enabled the force to remain  <br>solid firm and gave serious setbacks to
            the enemy. He borne the brunt of fighting for six months but never <br> complained
            owing to the noble cause. Because of his courageous acts, he was awarded <b>“Sitara-e-Jurat”</b>. He was <br>also given the title of <b>“Fateh-e-Gilgit wa Baltistan”.</b>.</p>

       <div class="text mt-2"><p>Raja Muhammad Babar Khan was born at Royal Palace of Nagar. He was
            son of great Mir of Nagar, Sir Shah Sikandar <br> Khan. Babar Khan is a notable
            figure in Gilgit’s history, <b>known for his extra ordinary courage.</b> He led the
            local forces <br> against the Dogra rulers. Under his charismatic and bold
            leadership, local forces launched a successful uprising <br> against the
            oppressive Dogra forces, leading to the liberation of the region. <br>
            Babar Khan’s military strategy and leadership were instrumental in
            achieving the victory, making a turning point in the <br>struggle for indepen-
            dence of Gilgit-Baltistan. In 1935, he joined the traditional Gilgit Scouts by following his elders <br> as Viceroy Commission Officer. Because of his
            impressive performance, he reached to the rank of Subedar Major, the <br>highest rank given to the local muslim. On 31 October 1947, he revolted
            against Dogra Raj, took his Commanding <br> Officer Major William Brown in
            confidence and <b>arrested Governor Ghansara Singh.</b> On 1 November
            1947, at Gilgit <br> Scouts Camp, for the <b>first time he raised Pakistan Flag</b> and
            announced freedom in huge gathering at playground. For <br> next 15 days,
            there was an interim setup formed as Independent State of Gilgit and he
            was <b>appointed as Quarter <br> Master General till accession to Pakistan.</b> <br>                    
             In 1947-48 war, he led the liberation war by his bold planning and
            dynamic leadership and thus was able to <br> contribute in liberation of 27,000
            miles of an area from Indian Dogra Raj. Because of his hircolious act, he
            was <br> honoured with commission and served in Gilgit Scouts till his
            retirement as a Major. In recognition to his extraordinary <br>act of bravery, he
            was awarded “Sitara-e-Quaid-e-Azam” equivalent to <b>“Sitara-e-Jurat”</b>.

            of his <br> achievements included <b>capturing of an Enemy Post (Enemy OP) in
            Domel Sector in January 1998, establishment of <br> 7 posts in Goma Lungma

                        In first week of July 1999, Captain Sher was tasked to remove an
            enemy blocking position between own <br>  <b>Kashif Post - 129B (Tiger Hill) and
            Wakeel Post - 129C.</b> He was accompanied by 14 individuals during this

            Subedar Aleem Zar Shaheed, Sitara-e-Jurat. Sher <br> attacked the enemy
            position at first light on 5 July 1999 from two sides, with a group of seven
            men each and after <br> having fought a fierce battle of about one hour successfully cleared the enemy position; seven soldiers including <br> Naib
            Subedar Aleem Zar embraced shahadat in this operation. While he sent
            Sepoy Ibrahim to get reinforcements, <br> Captain Sher spotted another blocking
            position and heavy enemy concentration forming up for attack on Kashif
            Post. <br> Despite heavy odds, he stunned the enemy by deciding to attack with
            remaining soldiers. During this daring action, all <br> seven soldiers including
            Captain Sher was <b>hit by a sniper and embraced shahadat.</b> His heroic action
            forced the <br>enemy to pull back, suffering heavy losses. His chivalry and
