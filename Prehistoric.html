Central Asia and the Upper Indus valleys. Nomads and Horse-Breeders from the vast Northern  <br>
steppes apparently entered this area, as attested by carvings of numerous two-wheeled chariots <br>
with spoke wheels found in Diamer Region. Similar carvings have also been found in Central <br>
Asia, Western Tien Shan, Altai, South Siberia and Mongolia. Rock art sites in Kazakhstan show <br>
more than 100 vehicles of dierent types. They represent the largest group of this motif dating  <br>
from the Middle Bronze Age to the stage of the early nomads, around the 17th-16th century BC.  <br>
This pan-steppe phenomenon seems to have anticipated  <br>
the emergence of the later Scytho-Sakan world which  <br>
inuenced the Upper Indus Region at least since the <br>
Late Bronze Ag</p>

  <p style="padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px; line-height: 35px; font-size: 19px;">16. The Great Kushana Kingdom in North-West Pakistan  commenced in the rst decades of the 1st <br>century AD till its collapse after 270 AD. From this point onwards, inscriptions feature signicantly in   <br> the region. Even though the inscriptions carved on rocks comprised mainly names  they provide  <br> information about the religious and political situation during the 1st millennium AD.More than 5000 <br>inscriptions with nearly a dozen dierent scripts have been documented. Kharoshthi, with more than   <br>300 inscriptions,  represents the earlier Buddhist Period. They mark the entry of a new religion <br>
into the region. Around 80 % of the later inscriptions are written in Brahmi, the second <br>
Indian script of the 3rd - 8th century AD,with its later versions Sharada and Proto-Sharada,<br>
used in the late Buddhist period. More than 700 Sogdian, Bactrian, Parthian, and Middle Persian <br>
inscriptions testify the presence of Central Asian Traders mainly originating from Samarkand. <br>
Additionally Chinese and Tibetan inscriptions, the latter representing the Tibetan dominance <br>
especially in Baltistan during the 8th century AD, and one even in Hebrew found at Gichi, <br>
highlight the region’s ethnic and religious diversity. Fire-altars symbolize the presence of the <br>
Zoroastrian Religion, introduced during the Kushana Period</p>
